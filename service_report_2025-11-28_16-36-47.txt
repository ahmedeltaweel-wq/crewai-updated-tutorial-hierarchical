- Priority: Normal (Severity Level High based on financial impact)
- Status: Investigation Ongoing - Site Visit Scheduled

## Details
- Information provided by each department:
    - **Billing Specialist Team:** Provided initial context, confirming the massive deviation from historical consumption and the customer's reported absence during the billing cycle.
    - **Technical Services (Diagnosis):** Identified the sudden 7x consumption increase, confirming that the high bill likely stems from a non-consumption-related fault (Administrative Error, Metering Fault, or Internal Load Fault).
    - **System Review (MDAS Check):** Confirmed the smart meter was communicating correctly, and the Meter Data Acquisition System logs validated that the charged consumption (approx. 8,500 kWh) was accurately recorded by the meter.
    - **Administrative Review:** Confirmed that the bill was based on an **Actual reading**, and that the correct tariff structure was applied without any clerical or systemic administrative errors.
- Proposed solutions:
    1. Customer instructed to record current meter reading and take photographs for immediate cross-reference.
    2. Mandatory on-site technician visit scheduled to physically verify the meter, confirm its serial number, check for visible faults, and investigate potential high-consumption internal loads.
- Actions taken:
    1. Remote Data Retrieval (MDAS Check) completed, validating the consumption data integrity.
    2. Administrative Review completed, ruling out billing system or clerical errors.
    3. Technician site visit has been scheduled.

## Follow-up Steps
- What the customer should do:
    1. Ensure clear and safe access to the meter for the technician on the scheduled date.
    2. Monitor the meter area for excessive heat, buzzing noises, or burning smells. If observed, immediately switch off the main breaker.
    3. Prepare to discuss any recent changes to large appliance usage or the property's electrical load history with the attending technician.
